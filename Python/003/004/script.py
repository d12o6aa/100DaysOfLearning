# 1. Write a program that declares two integer variables and perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on them. Print the results to the console.
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
print("addition : ")
print(x+y)
print("subtraction : ")
print(x-y)
print("multiplication : ")
print(x*y)
print("division : ")
print(x/y)

# 2. Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to input the length(integer) and width(integer) of the rectangle, calculate the area (length * width), and print the result.

w = int(input("enter the width"))
h = int(input("enter the height"))
print("the area of rectangle is : ")
print(w*h)

# 3. Modify the above program to read decimal numbers as the length and width, and output the area to two decimal points
ww = float(input("enter the width"))
hh = float(input("enter the height"))
print("the area of rectangle is : ")
print(w*h)
