# Day 2 - Variables

## 1. Create variables for your name, age, and favorite color and print them.

## Reading List:

### 1. Learn the terms: initialization, declaration and assignment of variables

####  In dynamically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at runtime. This means you do not need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it; the language interpreter infers it based on the assigned value.

### 2. Learn the difference between Dynamically typed and Statically typed variables

#### In statically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at compile-time, meaning you must explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it. Once declared, the variable can only hold values of that type.
